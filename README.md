# Islamic-Wordle

Islamic Wordle is a simple word guessing game that tests your knowledge of Islamic terms. The objective of the game is to guess a randomly selected Islamic term in six attempts or less. The game provides feedback on the accuracy of each guess, indicating whether each letter is in the correct position, in the word but in the wrong position, or not in the word at all. Additionally, a hint for the word is provided after the fourth unsuccessful attempt.

The game uses an AVL tree to store and retrieve Islamic terms and their definitions efficiently. The AVL tree is implemented using Python.

## Getting Started

To get started with the game, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download Python 3 from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Next, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

    git clone https://github.com/anisfazlin/Islamic-Wordle.git

Once you have cloned the repository, you can run the game by executing the islamic_wordle.py file:

    python islamic_wordle.py

## How to Play

To play the game, simply type your guess for the word in the entry box and click the "Guess" button. You will be provided with feedback on the accuracy of your guess, and you can continue to guess until you either guess the word correctly or reach the maximum number of attempts.

If you enter an invalid guess (i.e., a guess that is not an existing Islamic term), you will be prompted to enter a valid guess.
